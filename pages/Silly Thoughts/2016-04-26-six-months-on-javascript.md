# Switching From Ruby To 100% JavaScript, 6 Months Later

So, interestingly enough, it was roughly 6 months since I wrote the last line of
code in #ruby. As my job changed, I decided to go 100% #javascript for a change,
and see what happens. And, as I reached this milestone, I thought this might be
a good opportunity to reflect on the decision.

I've been working with ruby and rails for a really long time—in ruby terms that
is. I learned ruby before rails was cool. I shipped my first production rails app
in rails v1.1.x and scaled it to ~2M uniq users per a day in rails 2.1.x. Comparing
to my previous experiences with PHP, Python and Java, Ruby was a revelation. And I
had a blast working with Ruby for the last 10 years.

The thing is though, I liked JavaScript too. Even before Ruby was cool. Back then
it was this tiny immature language, and it was just fun to see how far I can
push it. I reckon many devs had similar feelings towards it back in the day. So,
I had this life long affair with JavaScript all this time.

Both JavaScript and me were maturing for a long time. Meanwhile Ruby kind of stuck
in 1999. It is a great language and I have an immense respect for its creators,
but it wasn't moving anywhere in the last 5 years. Every time a new Rails version
is released and DHH would go on a stage and say something like "oh, hey, we have
invented websockets! and by the way, everyone else is an idiot", it would make
me cringe; a lot.

That is the thing with Ruby and its community. It is really awesome language.
In fact, it is so good, that it automatically implies quality almost in anything
people write in it. You go to ruby conferences and all you hear in there is how
awesome ruby is, and all those semi-xenophobic talks about linguistic superiority
of Ruby and so on.

The flip side to this feeling of superiority is that it automatically implies
that if you not using Ruby, you're a moron. And we would push really hard to
use Ruby for everything, because, well, you don't want to look like a moron,
do you? You just want to fit in and be loved, right?

The thing is, this approach breeds conformity like nothing else. Pretty soon,
we ended up with a really "awesome" but almost monolithic community where everyone
is pretty much the same. The most maverick thing you'd see is that someone picked
a different database for a project. And god forbid if it is a NoSQL one!

Don't get me wrong, I'm not judging. This is a perfectly normal decision and I
am sure many will find it very fitting. I think ruby will keep living on for a
long time. But, not for me, I can't really live like that. I'm like a shark, if
I stop moving I die. I need something with more chaos and diversity to feel
happy.

So, last year I decided to go 100% javascript for a while. And if you're wondering,
yes, it is still a huge mess. Yes, it is still full of hipsters, like coding on
a typewriter kind of hipsters. And, yes it is still the same single threaded
nonsense. But you know what? That is not the point.

JavaScript is the most diverse and quickly growing community on this planet. It
is not even a community. There are so many areas where it is used, like, the
front end and the server side, mobile, desktop apps, gaming, embedded devices.
It is greatly fragmented, and even most of those areas are fragmented even further;
breaking around specific frameworks or paradigms. And that is beautiful to me.

See, unlike in any other languages that consider themselves more "professional",
you can do pretty bold shit in JavaScript and not be judged. This reduced cost of
failure breeds innovation like nothing else. JavaScript community sips through
more concepts and ideas in a year than Ruby/Rails did in it's entire life cycle.
Yes, it is really hard to keep up with. But, get over it; it's not about you,
you know?

That is also true that JavaScript community is full of low grade devs. I'm not
denying this. But, on the other hand it is also very welcoming. And you know,
I'm good with this. I'm more than capable of making my own decision, I don't
need someone to hold my hand. And besides, there are still plenty of great minds
in it to feel challenged too.

And as for the technical side of it. This is a very interesting thing. JavaScript
is limited in this regard. Even with babeljs and modern async/await features, it
is still a pain to build a large scale project in JavaScript. Everything becomes
terrible very quickly.

But then you know what? Remember the good old joke? _"Good, Cheap, Quick - pick
two?"_ I was thinking about this a lot lately. I think this is not a joke at all,
I think it is a trick question. Because `cheap + quick` is always `good`. And
that is precisely what JavaScript is. It is a cheap and quick tool to build all
sorts of things.

This is, by far, not everyone's best choice. If you went to the uni where they
taught you to despise less educated developers for 5 years, chances are JavaScript
will feel fragile and utterly "non professional". The thing is though, this is
your problem, not a JavaScript's one.

The world of programming languages is so saturated those days, that we almost
feel that programming languages should chaise developers. Make them happy.
I believe that one of the most harmful things that Ruby brought up into existence
is the concept of a developer happiness. The idea that a developer should just
kick back, relax and things will happen magically for them.

In my mind this is a straight road to get weak and spoiled. I believe in fitness,
both physical and metal. I believe that to perform at your best, you shouldn't
be put in a climate controlled room full of pillows and candies. As a mammal,
you need to face challenges on a regular basis, you need to work for your meal.

So, people do complain about the technical side of JavaScript all the time. But
most of those people don't use it consistently, they just want to kick back and
be chased after; like a damsel in distress. Where they see problems with the
language I actually see sheer awesomeness. JavaScript practically forces you
to build small modular things with short lifespan. That is healthy thing for a
software project. And its diversity provides you with more variety and options
that you can mentally process. Isn't that great to have all those vitamins and
micro-elements in your body!?

Truth is, I grew a bit indifferent to all those languages and frameworks that
promise to save humanity from idiot programmers. It is almost always a false
front to feed you with some fast-food solutions until you get dumb and then
control all your technical decisions for the next 10 years. That all there
really is to it.

Ok, this was already a pretty long rant. So, I'll wrap it up and leave you with
this thought. As a developer, how much time do you actually spend writing code?
I for one feel like it's roughly a 1/6 of my time; and I'm still a very active
developer. So, considering that most programming languages are pretty much Turing
complete and used in a very similar way, who much impact do you think a different
programming language will make on your overall performance as a developer, once
you master it? 2-5% I reckon?

So, wouldn't it be a smarter approach to think how much everyday routine things
a language solves for you, rather than fap on it's pure functional features? Not
like I think that there is something wrong pure functional features, after all
I'm a nerd, just like you. I just want to make you understand why I think JavaScript,
although being a terrible language, is the most practical option for a full stack
developer at this given moment in time.

Overall, despite my fears, switching to 100% JavaScript didn't turn into a
love-hate relationship. It turned into a love and acceptance type of a thing.
It is chaotic, just like life, and that's okay. You only get better at both
when you let go of your impulses to control everything.
