# Colemak, First Impressions

So, I've spend a few days learning the #colemak keyboard layout. And I think,
I should write down some thoughts and impressions. Which are strange, good and
bad at the same time.

It is hard to pin down the exact details, as it is more of a "feel" thing at
the moment, but colemak is kind of cool. The central idea—at least how I
understand it—is to move the most frequently used letters under the home row
of a keyboard. I don't know how much psychosomatic that is, but I can feel
how much less my fingers move on a keyboard. It is kind of bizarre thing, you
can type a lot of stuff without moving your fingers much up and own.

Another interesting thing is that they had put the letter "o" under the right
pinky. And it's kind of interesting, because you don't normally use your pinky
to type letters. But, when you have an actual letter under it you strangely feel
that the work is spread between your hands in a more balanced way.

What else? Comparing to QWERTY, colemak feels (at least to me) that it is easier
to type sequences. Again, it is a bit hard to explain, but when you type in
QWERTY, your fingers kind of move all over the place when you type a word. When
the Colemak was developed, they looked a lot at the letter sequences in English.
So, they've done what is called "path" optimizations. There is not that much
jumping around the keyboard going on when you type in Colemak, it is much easier
to produce fast combos. Somehow it reminds me how triplet work on a guitar, when
you play three notes quickly on the same string. Dunno, it's strange.

Either way, so far those are my impressions. I kind of learned most of the new
layout, but I'm nowhere near at typing on my own :)
