# Surfing: Get In Line

The last weekend Manly was packed with people. And, as I am still just learning,
I thought I need some space. So, I drove to another beach this weekend. Maruobra
beach that is. The northern end of Maruobra seems to have a very gorgeous break.
Too bad that I'm too young and stupid to get there yet. Well, will see in couple
of years.

Fun thing is though, that Maruobra is also packed on Saturday mornings. It is
interesting how in one's pursuit to be left the fuck alone, you inevitably run
into a line. Humans...

Either way, I think I have figured how to get over the break. I'm getting there
consistently. I see now where to get in, how to navigate between shoulders and
so on. Now I got to the hard part, catching the actual real waves.

Some time ago, a friend of mine told me that surfing is one of the hardest
sports to learn. I was cocky back then, now I see what he meant. It is really
hard to figure on our own. It takes a lot of practice and the long repetition
cycle doesn't help much.

Although, I'm starting to see patterns in swell, and a structure in the whole
processes starts to emerge. But, the number of moving parts is just overwhelming
at the beginning. So, I do what I do get best: I get smacked around a lot.

Sometimes I get lucky and things click and I get somewhat of a ride. But, mostly,
I either miss it or I get washed. I'm not really in control of what's happening.
The good thing though it's fun. Unlike skating or snowboarding, making mistakes
doesn't hurt that much in surfing.

I'm learning a lot of patience those days, hehe.
