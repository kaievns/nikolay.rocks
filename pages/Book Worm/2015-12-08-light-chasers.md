# The Dark Side of Lightchasers

I kind of have weird role models in life. I remember, when I was growing, they
would try to hook you up with the classical list, like: "oh, you like rockets,
you should try to be like Gagarin and brush your teeth; coz all astronauts brush
their teeth before bed." And I'm still a huge nerd, I mean, let me touch an
exhaust of a rocket engine and I'll be your friend forever, but Gagarin? He is
a brave guy and totally brushes his teeth twice a day, but I'm kind of more
interested in how rockets work rather than who gets the ride.

Either way, I'm kind of a fan of [Karl Jung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung).
Say what you want about the guy, but he is to our understanding of human
consciousness is what Gutenberg to books printing. They guy practically invented
archetypes and subconsciousness in the way we reason about it today.

It kind of works like so. Imagine you are a huge, perfect castle. You have those
awesome walls and towers, and you are full of perfect in every way rooms. And
every room of your castle has an awesome treasure in it. You are like an ideal
version of a castle.

But then, someone comes over and says: "oh, this room. I saw a similar room in
another castle and yours is like totally pales in comparison. maybe you should
lock it up and don't show it to anyone." And, you lock it up. Because, you want
people to love you and you don't want them to see your less than awesome rooms.

And you start to go around and look at other castles. Some of them have more
rooms than you do, some of them less. But, you just want to fit in. You don't
want people to dislike you because have more or less of some stuff in you than
others. So, you start to shut down more and more rooms.

And this process goes on and on. You start to forget you ever had some of the
rooms. Your start to completely abandon whole wings of your castle so you didn't
have to see certain sections of your interior. And you keep doing this until
you start to believe that you're just a two bedroom apartment that desperately
needs fixing.

This book is awesome! I never saw someone to put those complex ideas of sub-
consciousness and ego projections into such simple and easy to reason about
images. I enjoyed the whole thing cover to cover.

So, if you're like into sub-consciousness and stuff, and don't mind to read
less than academic texts, you should totally give this one a go.
